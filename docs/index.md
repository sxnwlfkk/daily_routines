Thank you for visiting the Daily Routines website. Here you can find useful information about the Daily Routines Android app, which is a labor of love, free and open source.

New Feature: Composition
------------------------

If you are new here, read on, but if you know your way around Daily Routines, head over to the [Composition article]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-07-20-Composition.md %}), to learn about this fancy new feature.

Who is it for and what does it do?
----------------------------------

The goal of Daily Routines is to let you easily manage your time when building routines. It's for those, who have trouble focusing on the task at hand. Those, who are having a hard time getting ready in the mornings. Those, who want to make their lives more fulfilling, with them still holding the reins.

Daily Routines have two basic modes of operations. First, there is the __regular routine__, which is just that, a routine, you can customise and optimise to your heart's content. However, you can use the __deadline routine__, where you set an end time, when you by all means want to be in your clothes, keyes in your hand and ready to go. Daily Routines will take care of achieving that, even if you sleep in a little, or brush your teeth a bit too long.

Leftover time
-------------

The concept of the leftover time is one of the main features of Daily Routines. When you finish a routine item early, you get to use those seconds or minutes later. If you spend too much time on a given todo, the program will distribute the time loss among the remaining items proportionally. Either way, you'll be able to enjoy your routines, without the risk of being late.

More, it you set an end time to your routine, Daily Routines will keep your optimal start time in mind, when you begin your routine. If you started a bit late, it will distribute the lost time with the above method. Otherwise, if you start early, you get that time bonus in your leftorver time counter.

Sample Routine
--------------

Here is a sample morning routine, to get you started:

1. Wake up, 5 min
2. Wash face, 1 min 30 sec
3. Prepare coffee, 4 min
4. Read a motivating book, 10 min
5. Plan my day, 10 min
6. Breakfast, 20 min
7. Get dressed, 10 min
8. Brush teeth, 3 min
9. Free time, 0 sec

The last item, __Free time__ has a 0 second length. If you have leftover time when you finish your last item, you may proceed to free time, without actually finishing the routine before time. This has the benefit, that you statistics will be more accurate, and you'll have more information, when the time comes to optimise. However, this is just an option for you to choose, you can put it in the middle or leave it out entirely.

If you set 7:30 AM as your end time with the above items, Daily Routines will calculate your optimal start time and remind you at 6:26 AM, to begin your routine.

Optimisation
------------

Daily Routines will start gathering information about your routines -- which are private and kept on your device -- when you first start to use them, in the form of runtime averages. When you finished a routine at least two times, you can start to optimise it in the editor (options menu, Optimize Routine). It will update the items of your routine to their current averages. However, it's not saved immediately, so you can customise the values to your liking before clicking the Save button.

Backup and Restore
------------------

__Backup and Restore functionality is still experimental, please use it with caution.__ Check out the [Backup and Restore]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-6-23-Backup-and-restore.md %}) page to learn more.
