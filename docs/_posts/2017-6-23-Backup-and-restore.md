__Backup and Restore__

__Backup and Restore functionality is still experimental, please use it with caution.__ Daily Routines will try to put the backup file in the root of the user drive as `daily_routines_backup.drdb`. Also, this is the file it will try to restore, if you select that option.

Keep in mind, backup will overwrite the last backup file with the same name, so it you want versioning, at the moment your best option is to copy it someplace safe and rename it. Later, if you want to restore it, just copy it back to the root of the directory and rename it to `daily_routines_backup.drdb`.
